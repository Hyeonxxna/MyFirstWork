uSaid I'd never fall, I'd never fall. I'd never fall, but then I fell for you, mm. Back against the wall, against the wall. Against the wall, that's how it felt with you, mm, mm. One weekend in Portland. You weren't even my girlfriend. We were walkin' and talkin'. Then somebody said. Let's get tattoos together, something to remember. If it's way too soon, fuck it, whatever. Give me shapes and letters, if it's not forever. Then at least we'll have tattoos together.<br>
Mm, 'cause I love you. Mm, 'cause I love you. Mm, 'cause I love you. Mm<br>
Knew it from the moment, from the moment. From the moment that I saw you naked, mm, yeah. I could never love nobody else, nobody else The way I loved you, baby, mm, mm. One weekend (weekend), no sleepin' (sleepin'). You weren't even my girlfriend, yeah. We were kissin', like, real kissin'. Then somebody said.<br>Let's get tattoos together, something to remember. If it's way too soon, fuck it, whatever. Give me shapes and letters, if it's not forever. Then at least we'll have tattoos together.
