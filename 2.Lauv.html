<h3>What is this song?<h3> 
We were so beautiful. We were so tragic. No other magic. Could ever compare. I lost myself, seventeen. Then you came, found me. No other magic. Could ever compare.<br>
There's a room. In my heart with the memories we made. Took 'em down but they're still in their frames. There's no way I could ever forget, hmm.
For as long as I live. And as long as I love. I will never not think about you.<br>You, hmm. I will never not think about you. From the moment I loved. I knew you were the one. And no matter whatever I do.<br>
Ooh, hmm I will never not think about you. What we had only comes. Once in a lifetime. For the rest of mine. Always compare.
