<h3>What is this song?<h3> 
All I know is (ooh ooh ooh). We could go anywhere, we could do. Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in. Yeah all I know is (ooh ooh ooh). 
Getting lost late at night, under stars. Finding love standing right where we are, your lips.<br> They pull me in the moment. 
You and I alone and. People may be watching, I don't mind. 'Cause anywhere with you feels right. Anywhere with you feels like. 
Paris in the rain. Paris in the rain.<br> We don't need a fancy town. Or bottles that we can't pronounce. 
'Cause anywhere, babe. Is like Paris in the rain.<br> When I'm with you ooh ooh ooh. When I'm with you ooh ooh ooh. 
Paris in the rain. Paris in the rain.
